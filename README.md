# Gambling-web-portal-
Local action: http://localhost:4567/home

Implemented a web application using the Sinatra framework that enables users to bet on games. Provided an interface to log in and sign up and implemented session and database support to keep track of users' total wins and losses. Displayed the total wins and losses for each user since the start of the betting.
Also used Slim and Sass to customize the look and feel of the application and PostgreSQL and SQLite to store and manage data. Developed using the thin web server.
